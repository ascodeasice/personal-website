    "aboutPara1": "My name is Leo Wang, and I am a web developer who uses the MERN stack. I am currently a third-year student majoring in CS at NCKU, Taiwan.",
    "aboutPara2": "While I specialize in MERN stack, my interests are diverse. As a result, I have tried many different languages and tools, such as AHK scripts, Android apps, Unity, CI/CD, Docker, and recently, I've been learning React Native and GCP. Although it may not always be directly related to my professional work, the process of learning new things is always interesting to me.\n\nStarting from August, I also began to engage with open-source software. I became a maintainer for the \"Contribute-To-This-Project\" project, helping many newcomers learn how to contribute to open-source projects and optimizing the speed of this project while adding useful functionalities.",
    "aboutPara3": "When I'm not busy, I try to add small features, assist in translations for the open-source software I use or like, or modify code to create my versions.\n\nOver the past year, I completed a half-marathon, received academic awards, made many friends, secured my first job, and I am still engaged in things that interest me. I continue striving to pursue a life centered around my passions and lead a life I truly love.",
